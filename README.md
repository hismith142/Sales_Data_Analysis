## Project Overview & Summary

### Step 1: Aggregate Data
Data was originally stored in 12 .csv files which I imported into a local databse using MySQL.
From there, I aggregated the data into a table using SQL queries and exported it as a .csv file for convenience.

### Step 2: Clean Data
I took the .csv file into a Jupyter environment and using Python's pandas library parsed down the data further.
Additionally, column datatypes were updated to reflect the needs of analysis later on in the project.

### Step 3: Develop Quesitons
I spent some time thinking about the questions a company might ask me to answer given the dataset. Some might include:
- The company is increasing its marketing budget; what is the optimal time of day to show advertisements to potential consumers?
- Given popular pairings of items, what would be an example of a promotional deal that would entice consumers to purchase from the company?
